# Kaggle DSTL Satellite Image Exploration on AWS

*By [Danny Luo](http://dluo.me)*

The notebook `image_exploration_aws.ipynb` is a brief exploration on AWS using boto3, the AWS SDK, of satellite images for the DSTL Satellite Image Feature Detection on Kaggle. It is useful for those attempting to use cloud computing to analyze the image data stored on AWS S3.

Adapted for AWS from [Cem Anil](https://github.com/cemanil)'s image exploration notebook.
